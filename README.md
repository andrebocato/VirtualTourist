# Virtual Tourist

## Description
* "Virtual Tourist" is one of Udacity's Swift Nanodegree Projects.
* The app has a map view. By long pressing anywhere on the map, an annotation is created and an album is downloaded for the given coordinates.
* Tapping an annotation sends the user to another view containing the downloaded album.
* The user can tap a photo to delete it or tap the "reload" button to delete the current album and download different images.
* **Note**: App implementation is outdated and does not reflect my current programming skills.

## Objectives
* This app was created as a final exercise for the Persistence basics lessons of the Nanodegree.

## API
* Data used in the app is fetched from the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
* All the information the app displays is mocked, it isn't real data from Udacity's students.

## Persistence
* App data is persisted using [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata).

## TODOs
* Refactor.
